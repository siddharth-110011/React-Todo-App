1. On Page refresh to main the session use the cookie send it to backend and 
set isAuthenticated value based on the response.

2. If the user is already logged in to make the user stay in tha same page when
they refresh the page, use an intermediate value for isAuthenticated and check
for it in the PrivateRoutes component.

When the user is not authenticated then isAuthenticated would be subsequently 
set to false and the user would be redirected to the Login page.
